# First step
So this is a form validator project 
and in this first thing that we'll work on is html, 
we'll write a basic html code to display the form,
which will contain username, email, password, confirm password,submit

## Second step
now creating basic css formatting 

## Third Step   
now let's move to the javscript part 
so we'll get all the elements by using document.getElementById, 
and we'll be targeting the elements which we'll be modifying
so its going to be form,username,email, password,and password2
and then we'll store them in const so that we can modify that

then we'll be adding event listner to what we'll listen, that is submit
